# Cardiovascular Diseases Prediction
Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree, to predict cardiovascular diseases. The aim was to determine the likelihood of heart attacks based on factors such as cholesterol, glucose, height, and gender.

Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 70,000 patient records with 12 features, including:

Age
Gender
Systolic blood pressure
Diastolic blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Glucose levels
Height
Weight
Smoking status
Alcohol intake
Physical activity
Presence of cardiovascular disease (target variable "cardio": 1 for disease, 0 for healthy)
The goal is to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on patient examination results.

Data Description
The input features are categorized into three types:

Objective: Factual information (e.g., age, gender).
Examination: Results from medical examinations (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol).
Subjective: Information provided by the patient (e.g., smoking status, physical activity).
This project aims to leverage these features to build predictive models for early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
